# MetaStanza

This was generated by [TogoStanza](http://togostanza.org), which enables the development of reusable web components that are embeddable into any web pages.

See [togostanza's README.md](https://github.com/togostanza/togostanza#readme) for details.

MetaStanza is a generic, flexible Stanza for data visualization with customizable parameters and styles so you can adjust it to meet the needs of your own applications and/or projects.

[Here](https://github.com/togostanza/metastanza-devel)'s a developmental version of MetaStanza (and [demo page](https://togostanza.github.io/metastanza-devel/)) which are rewrited with D3.js and have more functionarities.

Want to see more specific Stanzas already optimized for certain fields, applications, or projects? See [OpenStanza](https://github.com/togostanza/openstanza).
