# MetaStanza

MetaStanza is a generic, flexible Stanza for data visualization with customizable parameters and styles so you can adjust it to meet the needs of your own applications and/or projects. MetaStanzas are generated by [TogoStanza](http://togostanza.org), which enables the development of reusable web components that are embeddable into any web pages. See [TogoStanza's README.md](https://github.com/togostanza/togostanza#readme) for details on TogoStanza.

Note that, [here](https://github.com/togostanza/metastanza-devel)'s a developmental version of MetaStanza (and [demo page](https://togostanza.github.io/metastanza-devel/)) which are re-written with D3.js and have more functionarities.

Want to see more specific Stanzas already optimized for certain fields, applications, or projects? See [OpenStanza](https://github.com/togostanza/openstanza).
